# ABOUT ME
  I'm Hashique,a final year electrical and electronics engineering student pursuing graduation from MES college of engineering, Kuttippuram.I did my schooling at Airport school,calicut international airport. This page is about my fablab experiments.
  

          
# Welcome to my FabLab experiments
  A Fabrication Laboratory (FabLab) is a technical prototyping platform for innovation and invention which aims at providing stimulus for local entrepreneurship and serves as a platform for learning and innovation. It is a small scale workshop offering digital fabrication which empowers the users to create smart devices for themselves which can be tailored to local or personal needs.The Fablab mainly comprises of the following inventories:
  1. Laser Cutter
  2. Large Scale CNC Mill: Shopbot
  3. 3D printers: Dimension SST 3D printer and Ultimaker 2
  4. High Resolution Mini NC Mill: Modela
  5. Vinyl Plotter
  6. Sand Blaster
  7. Electronic Components and Tools
  8. Molding and Casting
  9. Electronics Test Equipments
  10. Computers

  The Kerala Startup mission is setting up Fab Labs in the state in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Centre of Bits and Atoms. Dr Neil Gershenfeld, director of the MIT Centre for Bits and Atoms pioneered the concept of fab lab.Fab Labs (Fabrication Laboratories) are facilities where people with minimal training can design and manufacture any product using advanced manufacturing machines linked to a computer. Fab Lab @ MESCE , Kuttippuram is the only fab lab in the Malabar Zone .
  
## FabLab workshop
  A 2 week Fablab workshop is being conducting at MESCE, Kuttippuram led by Mr.Muhammed Jaseel.
